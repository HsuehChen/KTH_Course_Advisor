# Skill
The robot acts as an advisor for students during course selection, by providing up-to-date information on courses and answering related questions.

## Description
This repository contains a Furhat skill developed for a course-selection user study at KTH.  
Users mention a specific course (e.g., by course code or name), and the system provides relevant information (e.g., credits, level, period, prerequisites, and a brief summary) and answers follow-up questions via dialogue.

The study compares two interaction modes with consistent course content:
- **Text-based mode:** dashboard text output + external display
- **Multimodal mode:** spoken dialogue + Furhat embodiment + external display

## Capabilities
- Understand user references to a specific course (course code/name)
- Present key course information in a structured, concise way
- Answer follow-up questions about the referenced course (e.g., credits, schedule/period, prerequisites)
- Support both text-only and multimodal interaction settings for user testing
